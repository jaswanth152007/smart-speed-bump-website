# 🚦 Smart Speed Breaker System

The Smart Speed Breaker System is an intelligent road safety concept designed to control overspeeding vehicles dynamically. Unlike traditional speed breakers that affect all vehicles, this system activates only when a vehicle exceeds the speed limit, improving safety, comfort, and efficiency.

## 📌 Project Overview

Conventional speed breakers cause discomfort, noise pollution, fuel wastage, and delays even for vehicles following traffic rules.  
This project proposes a **smart alternative** that responds based on vehicle speed, making traffic management more efficient and driver‑friendly.

The project is presented through a simple and informative website explaining the concept, working process, and advantages.

## ⚙️ How the System Works

1. **Speed Detection**  
   Sensors detect the speed of an approaching vehicle.

2. **Data Processing**  
   The detected speed is sent to a controller and compared with the predefined speed limit.

3. **Smart Activation**  
   - If the vehicle is within the speed limit, the speed breaker remains flat.  
   - If the vehicle overspeeds, the speed breaker activates to slow it down safely.

4. **Automatic Reset**  
   After the vehicle passes, the system resets for the next vehicle.
