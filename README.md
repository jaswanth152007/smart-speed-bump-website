Smart Speed Breaker System is an intelligent road safety concept that controls overspeeding vehicles dynamically. Sensors detect vehicle speed and activate the speed breaker only when limits are exceeded. This reduces unnecessary braking, noise, fuel consumption, and improves driving comfort while enhancing road safety.
